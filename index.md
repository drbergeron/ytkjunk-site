# Welcome to YTK Junk


## What is YTKJ?

YTKJ is an app for android and iOS that filters out all of the junk videos designed to make money off of our toddlers watching YouTube. Gone are all of the videos of surprise eggs, toys reviews, adults playing with toys, plus other low effort and key word optimized videos that show up while browsing as recommended videos and search results within our app. 

## Our philosophy

Young children should not be used as the primary revenue stream of some adult or family taking advantage of youtubes related video's algorithm to place their videos in with real content from content creators.  

## Our App

Your trust in us is our number one priority. That's why we don't have any additional advertising or tracking within our app (why we charge a small fee for it). This ensures we can cover the cost of hosting and development time of the service. 

## Why YTKJ?

Even though the standard YouTube Kids app has the ability to block videos, they have to be added manually. By using YTKJ you are able to mass block all junk videos identified by the YTKJ community and YTKJ staff without hours of monitoring what is being served by the YouTube service.
