# Welcome to YTK Junk


## What is YTKJ?

YTKJ is an app for android and iOS that filters out all of the junk videos designed to make money off of our toddlers that would otherwise show up using the natively developed Google app. Gone are all of the videos of surprise egg openings, toy reviews, grown adults playing with toys and other low effort or key word optimized videos that show up as recommended videos and search results within YouTube itself. 

## Our philosophy

Young children should not be used as the primary vechicle for likes and views by taking advantage of their inability to tell low effort cash-grab content from videos made by people or businesses looking for a quick cash grab.  

## Our App

Your trust in us is our number one priority. This is why we don't have any additional advertising or tracking within our app (and why we charge a small fee for it). This ensures we can cover the cost of hosting our service for a long time to come without having to resort to adversitements or subscription fees. 

## Why YTKJ?

Even though the standard YouTube Kids app has the ability to block videos they have to be added manually. By using YTKJ you are able to mass block all junk videos identified by the YTKJ community and YTKJ staff without having to spend time monitoring what is being served by the YouTube service and what your children are watching. This saves you time and gives you piece of mind knowing that your child is browsing in a much safer environment than the Google app. When inappropriate videos are identified, changes are picked up immediately by our app without the need for an app update. This helps keep data costs down while providing near real time updates of our blocked video database.   

### App Roadmap (in no particular order)
